<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> The product I am testing is a ride sharing service. A client sends their username, along with their current latitidue and longitude to a server. If the client is a passenger, the server returns data for all the vehicles that have recently checked in, and if the client is a vehicle, the server returns data for all the passengers that have recently checked in. My job was to find vulnerabilites in the client side and server side implementations of this service. Specifically, I looked for places where user information could be exposed and strange things could be sent and displayed on various pages of the service.

<h3> Methodology </h3>
<p> blah blah blah </p>

<h3> Abstract of Findings </h3>
<p> blah blah blah </p>

<h3> Issues Found </h3>
<p> 1. Query selector injection 
	<p> Sending username[$ne]=JANET as the query to GET /vehicle.json results in another vehicle's information being displayed.
	This is a very severe issue because it allows people to view information that they are not supposed to view. If this were a real ride sharing service, this could allow people to see someone's location, and how recently they were there. This can be fixed by rejecting any requests starting with $ using something called mongo-sanitize. Another solution would be to cast values to strings before running the query. </p>

<p> 2. JS/HTML injection
	<p> I sent javascript with script tags and HTML through curl and GET / executed the javascript code that I sent and displayed the HTML as I injected it. This is also a pretty severe issue. The code that I sent was not malicious, just annoying. But if I can execute simple code with a script tag, then more damaging JS code could be sent. As for the HTML, if anyone is able to inject HTML through sending data to a server, then bad stuff could get put up on a page. For example, I sent a link. Although the link I sent looks pretty sketchy, someone with more time and evil in their heart could send a nice looking link that downloads malware or something. It would also just mess with a website's look which is not good if it is a business or something. A way to fix this would be to sanitize inputs.
