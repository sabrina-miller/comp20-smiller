1. Correctly gets my location, places a unique marker for me, places passenger/vehicle icons for other users around me (I checked this by substituting one of the vehicle user names for my own). When you click on a marker, its username and distance away from me pop up (or closest vehicle/passenger). The icons for passengers are a little big even though I made them much smaller, this is more of an asthetic thing but if this were something a lot of people actually used I would make it look prettier. 

2. Didn't really collaborate with anyone on this assignment, I asked Emily Moise a couple of questions.

3. Spent approximately 3 hours on the assignment.
